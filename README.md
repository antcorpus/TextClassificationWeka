## TextClassificationWeka
This project is composed of two parts:
1. The first part is: the light stemming
In this part, we should mention in the file "param.txt" the file to stem and the stemmed file. 
To stem a file, we should execute the class main in the package stemmer.Analysis.
2. The second part: Text  classification using machine learning algorithms from Weka ToolKit. 
We should mention the Arff file to classify and the classifier, either SMO or NaiveBayes, in the file "param.txt". 
## Credits
We used the project "https://github.com/motazsaad/arabic-light-stemmer" as a basis for the stemming part and we modified it according to our need.
